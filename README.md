## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned more about how to interact and update the DOM. I had the opportunity to practice my JavaScript code. It's my second project trying to solve all the code myself, and this one was by far much easier than the first. Still, I had to rack my brains. That's the fun part.

### Continued development

I will continue practicing JavaScript and I will try to improve my HTML&CSS even further. I already feel comfortable with the last two, creating styles is no longer a difficulty, it's more a question of: "hm, how am I going to approach this?", I spend some time thinking and that's it, I have a beautiful style. I want to start trying to create more complex styles, to challenge myself more, and also to see how I get on creating content-heavy Semantic HTML.
